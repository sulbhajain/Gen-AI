We’ll start by setting up the environment, authenticating with the Hugging Face Hub, and running prompts through the model. Along the way, you’ll:\n","\n","- Practice **basic prompting** with Hugging Face pipelines  \n","- Build helper functions for smoother experimentation  \n","- Explore two test cases:  \n","  - ⚽ **Football classification** (Australian vs. American teams)  \n","  - 👽 **Alien speech translation** (synthetic Martian dataset)  \n","- Compare how the model responds to prompts with and without system instructions  \n","\n","This notebook sets the foundation for later steps in the series, where we’ll fine-tune the model and evaluate its performance.\n","\n","## Presetup Instructions\n","1. Get a [HuggingFace token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens), you only need need read only\n","2. Acknowledge Gemma license.   https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-270m\n","3. Click connect on the top right, you may need to click the drop down and select either a GPU or TPU. We'll talk more about the differences for each of these in the session.\n","\n","### Environment Setup\n","\n","Before we can run the model, we need to install a few libraries:\n","\n","- **PyTorch** (for deep learning computations)  \n","- **TensorBoard** (for tracking training and metrics)  \n","- **Hugging Face libraries** (transformers, datasets, etc.) for loading and working with models  \n","- *(Optional)* **flash-attn** for faster training if your GPU supports it (e.g. NVIDIA L4 or A100)\n","\n","Run the following cell to install everything. If you’re in Colab, this will only take a minute."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"BEK9IfKBqQaA","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1759842913309,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":41715,"user":{"displayName":"Sulbha
