The phrase is commonly used for \ntouch-typing practice, testing typewriters and computer keyboards, displaying examples of fonts, \nand other applications involving text where the use of all letters in the alphabet is desired.\nThe earliest known appearance of the phrase was in The Boston Journal. \nIn an article titled \"Current Notes\" in the February 9, 1885, edition, the phrase is mentioned as \na good practice sentence for writing students: \n\"A favorite copy set by writing teachers for their pupils is the following, because it contains \nevery letter of the alphabet: \n'A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'\" Dozens of other newspapers published the phrase over \nthe next few months, all using the version of the sentence starting with \"A\" rather than \"The\". \nThe earliest known use of the phrase starting with \"The\" is from the 1888 book Illustrative Shorthand \nby Linda Bronson. The modern form (starting with \"The\") became more common even though it is \nslightly longer than the original (starting with \"A\"). A 1908 edition of the Los Angeles Herald Sunday \nMagazine records that when the New York Herald was equipping an office with typewriters \"a few years ago\", \nstaff found that the common practice sentence of \"now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of\nthe party\" did not familiarize typists with the entire alphabet, and ran onto two lines in a newspaper \ncolumn. They write that a staff member named Arthur F. Curtis invented the \"quick brown fox\" pangram to \naddress this. As the use of typewriters grew in the late 19th century, the phrase began appearing in \ntyping lesson books as a practice sentence. Early examples include How to Become Expert in \nTypewriting: A Complete Instructor Designed Especially for the Remington Typewriter (1890), \nand Typewriting Instructor and Stenographer's Hand-book (1892). By the turn of the 20th century, \nthe phrase had become widely known. In the January 10, 1903, issue of Pitman's Phonetic Journal, \nit is referred to as \"the well known memorized typing line embracing all the letters of the alphabet\". \nRobert Baden-Powell's book Scouting for Boys (1908) uses the phrase as a practice sentence for signaling. \nThe first message sent on the Moscow–Washington hotline on August 30, 1963, was the test \nphrase \"THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG'S BACK 1234567890\". Later, during testing, the \nRussian translators sent a message asking their American counterparts, \"What does it mean when your \npeople say 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'?\" During the 20th century, technicians tested \ntypewriters and teleprinters by typing the sentence. It is the sentence used in the annual Zaner-Bloser \nNational Handwriting Competition, a cursive writing competition which has been held in the U S. since 1991. \nIn the age of computers, this pangram is commonly used to display font samples and for testing computer \nkeyboards. In cryptography, it is commonly used as a test vector for hash and encryption algorithms to \nverify their implementation, as well as to ensure alphabetic character set compatibility. Microsoft Word \nhas a command to auto-type the sentence, in versions up to Word 2003, using the command =rand(), and in \nMicrosoft Office Word 2007 and later using the command =rand old(). Numerous references to the phrase have \noccurred in movies, television, books, video games, advertising, websites, and graphic arts. The \nlipogrammatic novel Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn is built entirely around the \"quick brown fox\" pangram and \nits inventor. It depicts a fictional island off the South Carolina coast that idealizes the pangram, \nchronicling the effects on literature and social structure as various letters are banned from daily use by \ngovernment dictum.With 35 letters, this is not the shortest pangram. Shorter examples include: \"Waltz, bad \nnymph, for quick jigs vex.\" (28 letters) \"Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.\" (29 letters) \"How vexingly\nquick daft zebras jump!\" (30 letters) \"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.\" (32 letters) If \nabbreviations and non-dictionary words are allowed, it is possible to create a perfect pangram that uses \neach letter only once, such as \"Mr. Jock, TV quiz PhD, bags few lynx\".\"'''\n\n\ntemperature = 1.0\ndecay = True\nmax_length = 64\nprompt = \"Summarize the following content: \"\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(TOKENIZER_ID)\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_ID)\n\n# model.to(device)\nmodel.eval()\n\n# text = open(args.input).read()\n\n# if args.prompt:\n# Prepend a prompt in front of the input text\ntext = f\"{prompt}:\\n\" + input\n\n# Encode the text into a sequence of IDs\ninput_ids = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors=\"pt\") #.to(device)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-01T01:17:31.343336Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-01T01:17:31.343865Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-01T01:17:57.441274Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-01T01:17:31.343832Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-01T01:17:57.439955Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"tokenizer_config.json: 0.00B [00:00, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"b7e5f23db7cd43149bdb84c3812a5ab3"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"spiece.model:   0%|          | 0.00/792k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"671cbf1e0c04460cb4677cd610852e3e"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"tokenizer.json: 0.00B [00:00, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"17a439f0545d410aae965697d722d975"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stderr","text":"You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>.
