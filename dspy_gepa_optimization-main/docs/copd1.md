Abstract
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a devastating lung disease with a high personal and societal
burden. Exposure to toxic particles and gases, including cigarette smoke, is the main risk factor for COPD.
Together with smoking cessation, current treatment strategies of COPD aim to improve symptoms and prevent
exacerbations, but there is no disease-modifying treatment. The biggest drawback of today’s COPD treatment
regimen is the ‘one size fits all’ pharmacological intervention, mainly based on disease severity and symptoms and
not the individual’s disease pathology. To halt the worrying increase in the burden of COPD, disease management
needs to be advanced with a focus on personalized treatment. The main pathological feature of COPD includes
a chronic and abnormal inflammatory response within the lungs, which results in airway and alveolar changes
in the lung as reflected by (small) airways disease and emphysema. Here we discuss recent developments related
to the abnormal inflammatory response, ECM and age-related changes, structural changes in the small airways
and the role of sex-related differences, which are all relevant to explain the individual differences in the disease
pathology of COPD and improve disease endotyping. Furthermore, we will discuss the most recent developments of
new treatment strategies using biologicals to target specific pathological features or disease endotypes of COPD.

Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an
oftenseverelydisablingchroniclungdiseasewithahigh
prevalence of over 250 million cases worldwide. It is
currently the fourth leading cause of death globally and
is predicted to be the third by 2020 [1]. In the most
recent definition of the Global Initiative for Chronic
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), COPD is defined
as ‘a common, preventable and treatable disease that
is characterized by persistent respiratory systems and
airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar
abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to
noxious particles or gases’ [2]. This exposure can be
quite variable, with smoking being the main risk fac-
tor in high-income countries and indoor cooking and
occupational exposures representing important risk fac-
torsinlow-incomecountries.Thedefinitionandstaging
by GOLD is rather uniform, as defined by lung func-
tion,symptomsandexacerbationhistory,despiteCOPD
being a heterogeneous disease in its pathological mani-
festations in patients. It has long been recognized that

inflammation is a central hallmark of COPD, playing
a role in the pathological changes in all different lung
compartments [3]. Next to toxic exposures, genetic pre-
disposition is an important risk factor for COPD and
COPD represents a complex disease in which genetic
abnormalitiesincombinationwiththetypeandduration
of exposures determine the clinical phenotype [4]. The
development of novel 2D and 3Din vitroand ex vivo
models, as well as animal models that accurately reca-
pitulate the main features of COPD pathology, has been
very important for the study of disease mechanisms in
COPD and recent developments in this area have been
amply reviewed elsewhere [5–10].

Finally,wewilldiscussthemostrecentdevelopments
of new treatment strategies using biologicals to target
specific pathological features or disease endotypes (a

logical mechanism) of COPD.
Abnormal inflammatory responses in COPD
It has long been known that the innate immune system
plays a main role in COPD, as reviewed previously
[3]. Although it can be envisaged that noxious gases
will evoke such an immune response, the peculiarity
within COPD is that it is more extensive and damaging
and sustained for a longer time than, for example, in
smokers without COPD. Neutrophilic inflammation, as
observedintheinnateresponse,isstronglydependenton
IL-1-alpha, which is reported to be increased in COPD
patients[11,12]andalsomorereadilyinducedinCOPD
airway epithelial cells [13].
In the adaptive immune response in COPD, the pre-
dominant cell is the CD8 cytotoxic T cell. The presence
of this cell type in the airways as well as parenchyma
remains sustained over a long period of time, even up
to 3years after smoking cessation [14,15]. The find-
ing of lymphoid aggregates and follicles in COPD [16]
and, in particular, the confirmation of oligoclonality in
these follicles [17], fitted very well with the concept
of autoimmunity. In severe COPD, IL-18, associated
withlunglymphoidaggregates,hasbeenshowntodrive
IFN-gamma production, contributing to a Th1 response
[18]. Nevertheless, clonal B cell responses could be a
consequence of antigenic exposure due to the disease
(matrixcomponents,infectiousagents,immunecompo-
nents) and does not necessarily prove that this would
also contribute to disease [19]. More recently, the role
of innate lymphoid cells (ILC) in inflammatory disease
has received more attention [20]. Although this role in
COPD as yet is far from clear, group 3 ILC (ILC3)
appear to be the main subtype in COPD [20], suggested
to be involved in the initiation of the ectopic lymphoid
aggregates[21].Inaddition,ILC1werefoundtobeasso-
ciatedwithlymphoidcellinfiltrationandhavebeenpos-
tulated to play a role in emphysematous destruction in
COPD [22]. In COPD exacerbations it was shown that
ILC2 can switch to ILC1 and thus also contribute to
IFN-gamma-driven inflammation [23].
Type 2 inflammation, normally associated with
asthma, has also been described in COPD patients
without a history of asthma and was suggested to rep-
resent an endotype of COPD [24]. Obviously, this has
also been discussed as a representative of the ‘asthma
COPD overlap syndrome’ [25]. Furthermore, a key role
has been described for Th17 cells and their principal
cytokine, IL-17, at least in a subset of COPD [26–28].
In particular, human lung dendritic cells from emphy-
sema patients stimulated Th1 and Th17 responses [29]
and emphysema patients had higher Th17 cell levels,
which were responsive to elastin stimulationin vitro
[29]. Furthermore, the response to elastin stimulation
was associated with the percentage of emphysema
on CT scans, supporting a possible (T cell-mediated)
autoimmune phenomenon. A very recent study showed
an airway epithelial IL-17A response signature identi-
fying a steroid-unresponsive COPD patient subgroup
[28]. The authors suggested that such a gene signature
of IL-17 airway epithelial response distinguishes a
biologically, radiographically and clinically distinct
COPD subgroup that may benefit from personalized
therapy [28].
ECM changes in COPD
The lung ECM forms the main building blocks of the
lung. Disturbance of the ECM can have important con-
sequences leading to lung tissue remodeling, which can
affect all lung compartments (i.e. airway wall fibrosis
and emphysema) in COPD. The main ECM compart-
ments in the lung are the basement membrane, lam-
ina propria of the airways and the alveolar interstitium,
where the ECM connects the alveoli and blood vessels,
formingtheparenchyma. Themainproteincomponents
ofthebasementmembranearecollagenIVandlaminin;
in the lamina propria and interstitium they are fibrillar
collagens, elastin, fibronectin, glycosaminoglycans and
proteoglycans [30,31].
The main producers of ECM proteins in the lung
are fibroblasts and activated myofibroblasts, followed
by airway smooth muscle and airway epithelial cells
[32,33]. Degradation of the ECM is regulated by
endogenous proteases, of which MMPs are the main
type in the lung; their activity is regulated by tissue
inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). The balance
between these MMPs and TIMPs is essential for ECM
homeostasis [30,34,35].

626 C-A Brandsmaet al
A potential contributor of emphysematous lung tis-
sue destruction in COPD is the inflammation-related
increaseinMMPs(i.e.MMP-2,MMP-9andMMP-12),
leadingtoanimbalancebetweenMMPsandTIMPsand
a shift toward increased ECM degradation, especially
elastin [36–38]. Several studies have shown a reduc-
tion in elastic fibers in COPD, as well as disrupted
fibersanddisturbedelastogenesis[39–41].Additionally,
increased elastin gene expression was demonstrated in
severe COPD [37], as well as an upregulation of sev-
eral elastogenesis-related genes, including elastin and
fibulin-5,inCOPDlungtissue[42].Ofinterest,fibulin-5
appeared to be a key modulator of elastic fiber forma-
tion,withfibulin-5knockoutmicesufferingfromsevere
elastinopathy, resulting in loose skin, vascular abnor-
malities and severe emphysema [43,44]. Of interest,
fibulin-5proteinwasshowntobecleavedbyserinepro-
teases in vitro, resulting in disturbed elastogenesis [45].
Thus, the increase in elastin and fibulin-5 on the gene
expression level and the decreased presence of elastic
fibers and elastin fiber abnormalities in COPD suggest
a defect in the formation and repair of elastic fibers in
COPD, which is possibly related to increased levels of
cleaved non-functional fibulin-5 protein. In addition to
the concept that increased fibulin-5 gene expression is a
response of hampered tissue repair inCOPD, it hasalso
been proposed that the increased fibulin-5 expression in
COPD is involved in small airway fibrosis and is thus
detrimental [46].
Other important ECM changes in COPD include
increasedcollagendepositioninthe(small)airwaywalls
and structural changes in collagen fibrils, with more
disorganized collagen fibrils in COPD [47,48]. An
important contributing factor to this disorganization
of collagen is the lack of decorin deposition in the
adventitia of the small airways [49]. Decorin is a
proteoglycan that binds to collagen fibrils, providing
structuralsupport.Decorinalsobindsmanygrowthfac-
tors and their receptors, including TGF-beta, the main
induceroftissuerepair,therebyinhibitinggrowthfactor

COPD. An example of a diseased airway with lack of
alveolar support is shown in Figure 1.
Genetic regulation of ECM changes in COPD
The list of genetic variants associated with COPD or
reduced lung function is increasing rapidly [53–56].
Whether and which of these genetic variants have
functional consequences for COPD pathology and are
underlying ECM changes in COPD is a million dol-
lar question. Of interest, several recent genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) showed an enrichment of,
partlythesame,ECM-relatedgenesamongtheirlistsof
genetic variants for COPD and/or pulmonary function
(Table 1). Gharibet al[57] performed GWAS analysis
of pulmonaryfunction measures(forcedexpiratoryvol-
ume in the first second [FEV
1]a n dF E V1/forced vital
capacity [FVC]) in two large consortia (CHARGE and
SpiroMeta) and used gene set enrichment analysis to
identify pathways linked to pulmonary function. Inter-
estingly, their pathway analysis for airflow obstruction
(decreased FEV
1/FVC) resulted in a clear enrichment
of gene sets involved in ECM remodeling, including
the integrin pathway, proteinaceous ECM, collagen and
ECM. Subsequent network analysis identified MMP-10
as a candidate gene and they demonstrated a patho-
physiological role for MMP-10 in a mouse model of
smoke-induced emphysema [57].
Sakornsakolpat et al[58] used a new approach inte-
grating GWAS and existing gene expression data to
identify new genes for severe COPD. Using pathway
enrichment analysis, they demonstrated enrichment of
cellmatrixadhesionofcollagenbinding,whichincluded
three ECM-binding integrin genes (ITGA10, ITGA2,
ITGA1).
In 2017, Wainet al[54] published a large GWAS
study for lung function and COPD using the UK
Biobank. Integration of the genetic variants with exist-
ing expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) datasets
resulted in the identification of 234 genes with poten-
tially causal effects on lung function that were enriched
for several ECM-related genes, including molecules
related to elastic fibers, elastic fiber formation, ECM
organization and extracellular structure organization.
These gene sets included fibulin-5 as a potential causal
gene for impaired lung function. More recently, two
even larger GWAS studies for lung function and COPD
were published by Shrineet al[55] and Sakornsakolpat
et al [56], identifying 139 new genetic loci for lung
function and 35 new loci for COPD, respectively.
Again,pathwayanalysisofthelungfunction-associated
genesshowedthatmostsignificantlyenrichedpathways
were related to elastic fibers and ECM organization and
this also included a new signal for an ECM-binding
integrin, integrin alpha-V. A significant enrichment
of ECM-related pathways was also found among the
COPD-associated genes, including laminin binding,
integrinbinding,mesenchymedevelopment,cellmatrix
adhesion and actin filament bundles. Together with
the enrichment of lung development pathways among
the COPD-associated genes, these findings strongly
support a role for disturbed ECM development and
homeostasis in the development of COPD. Follow-up
functional studies are now warranted to disentangle the
exact disease-driving mechanism and to identify new
potential targets for intervention.
Aging and lung ECM changes in COPD

ing in increased risk of disease or death [59]. The aging

lungischaracterizedbyseveralphysiologicalandstruc-
turalchangesthatarealsopresentinCOPD,includinga
decline in lung function, decreased mucociliary clear-
ance, decreased antioxidant levels, senile emphysema
and altered ECM proteins [60]. Furthermore, mutations
ingenesresponsiblefortelomereshortening,ahallmark
of aging, have been associated with severe emphysema
[61,62]. Therefore, it has been suggested that acceler-
atedlungagingplaysanimportantroleinthepathogen-
esis of COPD [59,63].
Although ECM dysregulation was proposed as an
additional hallmark of the aging lung [64], it is not yet
completelyclearhowlungECMhomeostasisisaffected
by aging and how this may contribute to COPD. The
occurrence of airspace enlargement or senile emphy-
sema[65]andthedecreaseinelasticfibersandincreased
collagen deposition in the aging lung [66,67] are, how-
ever, indicative of lung remodeling.
It has been proposed that the aged lung is character-
ized by subtle changes in the ECM and lung architec-
ture, which does not directly cause disease or changes
in lung function, so-called transitional remodeling [68].
When the lung is then exposed to an additional insult,
like in COPD, these alterations may trigger an aber-
rantrepairresponseandcausepermanenttissuedamage.
This theory is in line with the findings of a recent lung
tissue gene expression study where it was shown that
genes involved in ECM–receptor interactions, includ-
ing three collagen genes, decreased more with age in
COPD patients compared with controls, suggesting a
defective repair response in COPD with aging [69]. In
addition,Calhoun et al[70]demonstratedanincreasein
ECM proteins, including collagen, with increasing age
in mice and human lungs, together with an increase in
senescent cells. In a more recent study [71], the link
between growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), a
member of the TGF family, and senescence in COPD
was investigated. GDF11 was decreased in plasma of
COPD patients and the protein was localized in mes-
enchymalcellsintheairwaywallandtheairwayepithe-
lium. Treatment with GDF11 attenuated emphysema
and cellular senescence in an elastase-induced emphy-
sema model, indicating a role for GDF11 in cellular
senescence in COPD.
The true role of age-related ECM changes in COPD
pathology is still to be determined, but it certainly
represents an interesting area for research. More so
because targets for pharmaceutical intervention can
potentially be applicable to other age-related diseases
as well. In this respect, it is of interest that novel
anti-aging treatment strategies are emerging that tar-
get cellular senescence with beneficial effects on lifes-
pan, lung aging and lung fibrosis in animal models
[72–74] and very recently also with beneficial effects
inpatientswithidiopathicpulmonaryfibrosis[75].This
first-in-human, open-label pilot study, where 14 idio-
pathic pulmonary fibrosis patients were treated with the
combinationofdasatinib(atyrosinekinaseinhibitorthat
targets anti-apoptosis pathways; used for the treatment
ofleukemia)andquercetin(anaturalproduct,flavonoid,
targeting anti-apoptosis pathways) showed significant
andclinicallymeaningfulphysicalimprovementinthese
patients. Further evaluation of these senolytic drugs in
larger randomized controlled trials is warranted.
Precision imaging for new insights into COPD

The majorsite ofairflowobstruction inCOPDhasbeen
shown, by direct measurements of resistance, to occur
inthesmallconductingairwaysthatare <2mmininter-
nal diameter [76–78]. Since then, there has been much
debate over the most important contributor to airflow
obstruction: structural changes within small airways or
lossofelasticrecoilduetoemphysematousdestruction.

To date, clinical thoracic CT scans have been validated
as a non-invasive imaging technique to correlate with
regional lung function [79] and to quantify emphysema
(<−950HounsfieldUnits)[80,81].However,thespatial
resolution of clinical CT scans, 800–1000μm, does not
permit the analysis of the smallest conducting airways,
or parenchymal structures [82–84]. The recent applica-
tionofmicro-CT,withaspatialresolutionofupto1 μm,
hasprovidedtheabilitytoresolvealveolarstructuresand
reliably identify terminal bronchioles, with an average
lumen diameter of 424μm [85]. McDonough and col-
leagues [85] used micro-CT to image tissue samples
from explanted lungs from patients with very severe
(GOLD4) COPD, and provided the first evidence that
terminal bronchioles are destroyed in end-stage COPD,
even in regions of lung with no emphysema measured
using mean linear intercept (a measure for airspace
enlargement). These data therefore suggested that loss
of terminal bronchioles may occur prior to the develop-
ment of emphysema. To test this hypothesis, Koo and

colleagues[86]usedacross-sectionalanalysisofsmok-
ers with normal lung function and patients with mild,
moderate and very severe COPD, and demonstrated
that terminal bronchioles are significantly destroyed by
41%inmild(GOLD1),43%inmoderate(GOLD2)and
69% in end-stage (GOLD4) COPD patients. Using the
robust measure of alveolar surface area, which trans-
lates to the functional tissue involved in gas exchange,
the study also reported that terminal and transitional
(first generation of respiratory airways) bronchioles
are lost in lung tissue in which no emphysematous
destruction is present, indicating that small airways
disease is an early pathological feature of mild and
moderate COPD.
Althoughmicro-CThastheresolutiontoassesssmall
airways, only CT and MRI modalities hold promise
for the early detection of obstructive lung diseases
and the characterization of disease pathology over
time. The recent application of parametric response
mapping (PRM) [87], which uses image registration to
match inspiratory and expiratory CT scans to examine
local changes in lung density, is now able to detect
emphysema (PRM emph) from non-emphysematous
gas trapping, termed functional small airways disease
(PRMfSAD). In a subsequent study using excised lungs
and micro-CT [88], it was validated that PRMfSAD is
associated with a lower number of terminal bronchioles
and a reduced terminal bronchiole lumen area, whereas
changes in alveolar surface area only correlated with
PRMemph. This is important, as Bhatt and colleagues
[89], using the COPDGene cohort of 1508 current
and former smokers, have shown that PRM fSAD is
associated with early disease, before the development
of airflow limitation, and contributed to a faster FEV1
decline than PRMemph. Furthermore, Labaki and col-
leagues [90], in a cohort of 725 smokers with and
without COPD, reported that PRMfSAD is associated
with regions of normal tissue over a range of COPD
severities and that subjects with the highest PRMfSAD
at baseline had the greatest increase in emphysema.
PRM has also been shown to correlate with GOLD
stage and several clinical parameters used to assess
COPD morbidity, such as BMI, 6 min walking distance
and quality of life as determined by the St-George
Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) [91]. In addition,
PRM
fSAD has been shown to be sensitive enough for
short-term (1 year) follow-up of COPD patients, with
PRMfSAD decreasing as PRMemph and tissue destruction
increase [92].
These studies therefore support the notion that
small airways disease is a precursor to the develop-
ment of emphysema. As a CT biomarker, PRMfSAD
has the potential to improve patient care through
improved screening, disease subtyping and monitoring
the response to treatment as an outcome measure.
Future GWAS to associate genes with PRM disease
subtypes will probably be informative compared
with the traditional lung function measures to iden-
tify potential therapeutic targets and early disease
markers.
Role of sex differences in COPD pathology
Although COPD has long been considered a disease
of males, its prevalence and mortality among females
have risen rapidly during the last decades and are now
equaltothoseofmales[93].Severalstudieshaveshown

report more symptoms of dyspnea and cough and have
a faster annual decline in FEV

pack-years of smoking [94–96]. In a population-based
cohort study (SAPALDIA) of 1792 current smokers,
Downs et al[96] investigated the effects of the num-
ber of cigarettes smoked per day on the course of lung
functioninmalesandfemalesmeasuredoveraperiodof

Interestingly, smoking-related FEV1 decline was accel-
erated in females with airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC
<0.7) compared with those without (FEV1/FVC >0.7),
the decline being−39.4 versus−12.2 ml/year per pack

not the case in males (FEV1 decline of −12.9 ver-
sus −8.8 ml/year per pack,p =0.07). The difference
between men and women with a reduced FEV1/FVC
was significant (p =0.05), indicating that women with

Among the entire group of first-degree relatives, males
and females demonstrated similar lung function. How-
ever,amongcurrentandex-smokers,femalefirst-degree
relativeshadsignificantlylowerFEV 1/FVCvaluescom-
paredwithmales(82 ±17%infemalesversus87 ±13%
in males, p =0.009) [98,99]. In addition, they more
oftenhadseverelungfunctionimpairment(FEV 1 < 40%
predicted) compared with male first-degree relatives,
suggesting that females are more susceptible to devel-
oping severe COPD.
It has been reported that females develop a differ-
ent type of COPD than males. They demonstrate less
severe emphysematous destruction for the same degree
of lung function impairment [95,98,99]. However, they
have more airway wall remodeling, with thicker small
airwaywallsrelativetothelumen[95].Arecentanalysis
of COPDGene subjects confirmed earlier findings that
males display more emphysema than females overall
for the same degree of airflow obstruction [100]. How-
ever, this was not the case in females with severe early
onset COPD, severe emphysema (percentage of lung
with low attenuation areas> 25%) and GOLD4 COPD.
These three phenotypic subgroups with advanced dis-
ease had comparable radiographic emphysema despite
fewer pack-years of smoking. This finding that females
with severe COPD demonstrate a similar degree of
emphysema with less smoke exposure is in line with
the notion that a subgroup is particularly susceptible to
developing COPD with smoking. The difference in sus-
ceptibility to smoking already starts at an early age, as
thegrowthinlungvolumesislessingirlscomparedwith
boys when they start smoking as adolescents [101].
Several factors might contribute to the increased sus-
ceptibility to smoking. A possible explanation is that
females have smaller lungs and therefore one pack
of cigarettes may represent a higher dose in females
than males. Another possible explanation would be dif-
ferent brands of cigarettes smoked or differences in
inhalationtechnique.Finally,hormonalandgeneticfac-
tors may drive the sex differences observed in COPD.
Tam et al[102] showed increased airway wall thick-
ness in female compared with male smokers at risk
for or with GOLD1 COPD. They recapitulated these
findings in a smoke-induced mouse model of COPD,
where female mice developed greater airway remodel-
ing,greatersmallairwayresistance,increasedTGF-beta
activityandareducedantioxidantresponseuponsmoke
exposure. These effects were prevented by ovariectomy
and in part also by tamoxifen treatment, indicating a
role for sex hormones. The CYP450 pathway, which
is important in drug metabolism and detoxification,
has been suggested to play a role, as it is known to
be affected by estrogen and several enzymes of this
family are increased in women (reviewed in [103]).
CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expression increases in cul-
turedbronchialepithelialcellsafterestrogenstimulation
[104]andhigherCYP450A1andCYP450B1expression
has been observed in primary epithelial cells of patients
with COPD compared with those without COPD [105].
CYP450 enzymes convert the cigarette smoke con-
stituent naphthalene to the far more toxic intermediate
metabolitenaphthaleneoxide,leadingtoarapiddeathof
club cells. Another study reporting different underlying
mechanismsofCOPDinmalesandfemaleswascarried
out by Kohleret al[106]. They investigated the bron-
choalveolar lavage fluid proteome in smokers with and
withoutCOPDandfoundatotalof19proteinstobesig-
nificantly differentially expressed [106]. Interestingly,
COPD-associated differential protein expressions were
completely driven by the female patients and included
cathepsin B (downregulated), ATP synthase (upregu-
lated) and chaperonin (upregulated). Pathway analysis
revealed that the lysosome activity pathway was signif-
icantly downregulated in females with COPD, which
was primarily driven by the decrease in cathepsin B.
Downregulation of lysosomal function has been linked
toautophagy,aconservedhomeostaticpathwayforpro-
teindegradationandregeneration.Thereisgrowingevi-
denceintheliteraturethatautophagyplaysanimportant
role in the pathogenesis of COPD [107].
Finally, genetic factors may play a role. In a
recent study by Hardin et al [108], sex-related
dimorphic genetic risk factors were examined in a
GWAS meta-analysis using three large COPD cohorts
(COPDGene, ECLIPSE, GenKOLS). A genome-wide
SNP*sexinteractionanalysisforCOPDwasperformed.

Emerging treatment strategies in COPD; potential
use of biologics
The chronic airway inflammation in COPD has been
traditionally characterized by neutrophilic inflamma-
tion. However, a subgroup of patients with COPD has
an eosinophilic phenotype [109], based on increased
peripheral blood eosinophil counts or increased per-
centages of eosinophils in induced sputum. Increased
blood eosinophil counts in COPD patients have been
associated with an increased risk of future exacerba-
tions [110,111]; chronic treatment with inhaled corti-
costeroids decreases this risk [112–114]. This and other
observations have led to the concept of treatable traits
in chronic airway diseases [115], as in both asthma and
COPDthepresenceofeosinophilicairwayinflammation

Recent advances in COPD pathogenesis 631
been shown to be a theragnostic biomarker, predicting
the therapeutic response to inhaled corticosteroids.
The next step is to investigate whether a precision
medicine approach using specific biologics targeting
eosinophilic inflammation would be as successful in
patientswithCOPDasinasthmatics.Indeed,inpatients
with severe eosinophilic asthma, three monoclonal
antibodies targeting the IL-5/IL-5 receptor axis have
been shown to significantly reduce exacerbation rates
[116–118]. Mepolizumab and reslizumab inhibit the
ligand IL-5, whereas benralizumab binds to the IL-5
receptor expressed on eosinophils and basophils, induc-
ing apoptosis and thus depleting these cells. In two
phase III double-blind, randomized, controlled trials
(METREX and METREO), monthly subcutaneous
injectionsofmepolizumabwereassociatedwithalower
rate of exacerbations than placebo in patients with
COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype [119]. How-
ever, whereas mepolizumab reduced exacerbation rates
in severe eosinophilic asthma by 50%, the effect of
mepolizumab in eosinophilic COPD was very modest
(approximately 15% reduction), although the same
cut-off values for blood eosinophil counts had been
applied as inclusion criteria in these trials for both
diseases. Moreover, whereas mepolizumab treatment
wasassociatedwithsignificantimprovementsinquality
of life in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, the
effects on patient-reported outcomes, such as SGRQ
and the COPD Assessment Test, did not reach the
minimal clinically important difference.
Several mechanisms might underlie the very mod-
esteffectsofmepolizumabinpatientswitheosinophilic
COPD: first, the role of eosinophils in eliciting acute
exacerbations in COPD might be less prominent as
compared with severe eosinophilic asthma; second, the
eosinophilic inflammation might be driven by other
mediators than IL-5, such as IL-3, GM-CSF, eotax-
ins and leukotrienes. As the cytolytic anti-IL5 receptor
monoclonalantibodybenralizumabdepleteseosinophils
(completely in blood and significantly in sputum and
mucosaltissues),clinicalstudieswithbenralizumabcan
help to disentangle the mechanisms of eosinophilic air-
wayinflammationinCOPD,aswellastheircontribution
to acute exacerbations. Interestingly, in two large tri-
als,theGALATHEAandTERRANOVAstudies,benral-
izumab – atdifferentdoses(10,30or100mgs.c.) – did
not affect the annualized exacerbation rate as compared
with placebo in patients with moderate to very severe
COPD, a blood eosinophil count of 220/μl or greater
andahistoryoffrequentexacerbations[120].Therefore,
in contrast to the clear clinical benefits of benralizumab
treatment in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma,
eosinophil depletion in COPD patients did not trans-
late to a reduction in exacerbations. This important

Take home message
To halt the worrying increase in the burden of COPD,
improved and personalized treatment strategies are
needed. Genetic risk factors, accelerated aging and sex
differences are important contributors to key features of
the individual’s disease pathology in COPD, i.e. Th2,
Th17 and/or autoimmune-type inflammatory responses,
ECM changes and disturbed cell–matrix interac-
tions, and small airways disease in COPD (Figure 3).
Improved insight into these pathological features and
more accurate diagnosis using precision imaging will
enable the discovery of new endotypes in COPD that
can be targeted by precision medicine in the future.
