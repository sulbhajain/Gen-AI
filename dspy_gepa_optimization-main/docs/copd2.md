Purpose. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant 
cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Exacerbations— 
acute worsening of COPD symptoms—can be mild to severe in nature. In-
creased healthcare resource use is common among patients with frequent 
exacerbations, and exacerbations are a major cause of the high 30-day 
hospital readmission rates associated with COPD.
Summary. This review provides a concise overview of the literature re-
garding the impact of COPD exacerbations on both the patient and the 
healthcare system, the recommendations for pharmacologic management 
of COPD, and the strategies employed to improve patient care and re-
duce hospitalizations and readmissions. COPD exacerbations significantly 
impact patients’ health-related quality of life and disease progression; 
healthcare costs associated with severe exacerbation-related hospitaliza-
tion range from $7,000 to $39,200. Timely and appropriate maintenance 
pharmacotherapy, particularly dual bronchodilators for maximizing bron-
chodilation, can significantly reduce exacerbations in patients with COPD. 
Additionally, multidisciplinary disease-management programs include pul-
monary rehabilitation, follow-up appointments, aftercare, inhaler training, 
and patient education that can reduce hospitalizations and readmissions 
for patients with COPD.
Conclusion. Maximizing bronchodilation by the appropriate use of main-
tenance therapy, together with multidisciplinary disease-management and 
patient education programs, offers opportunities to reduce exacerbations, 
hospitalizations, and readmissions for patients with COPD.

C
hronic obstructive pulmonary di -
sease (COPD) is a preventable and 
treatable disease with airway obstruc -
tion and is characterized by persistent 
respiratory symptoms. 1 COPD is esti -
mated to affect about 16 million adults 
in the United States.
2 Incidence of COPD 
is highest in patients who smoke or have 
a history of tobacco use, those older 
than 40 years, and men.1 Despite recom-
mendations that maintenance phar -
macotherapy be used for patients with 
moderate-to-severe COPD,
1 up to 71% 
of patients from a Medicare population 
did not receive maintenance therapy, 
highlighting opportunities for improve -
ments in patient management and care.3
COPD is defined as being “stable” 
when symptoms are well managed and 
pulmonary decline is minimized, while 
management of “unstable” COPD (in 
patients who experience frequent or 
severe exacerbations and a faster de-
cline in pulmonary function) can be 
more challenging. Exacerbations of 
COPD are a major contributor to the 
economic burden and, depending 
on severity, can result in the need for 
emergency department (ED) visits 
and hospitalizations.
4-7 Also, there is a 
positive correlation between disease 
severity and higher treatment costs.

CLINICAL REVIEW
MANAGEMENT OF COPD EXACERBATIONS
Program in 2014 to include COPD has 
highlighted the need for better manage-
ment to reduce frequent hospitaliza-
tions and readmissions associated with 
severe disease.
8 This review provides an 
overview of the impact of COPD on pa-
tients and, more broadly, the impact on 
the health system overall, and reviews 
the latest management guidelines for 
patients with COPD. We discuss how 
appropriate treatment can improve pa-
tient outcomes and reduce healthcare 
use and associated costs.
Impact of exacerbations on 
patients
Increases in exacerbation fre-
quency, severity, and length of re-
covery period have all been shown 
to significantly reduce health-related 
quality of life for patients with 
COPD.
9,10 In one prospective trial, the 
mean recovery time for symptoms to 
return to baseline levels following an 
exacerbation event was ~14.5  days, 
while the recovery of peak expiratory 
flow to patient baseline levels did not 
occur within 99 days for ~7% of exacer -
bations.
9 This suggests that lung func -
tion may undergo accelerated decline 
and may not fully recover following an 
exacerbation. Furthermore, recovery 
of lung function and symptoms to 
baseline levels following an exacerba-
tion was found to occur more slowly 
with each additional year of disease, 
making it harder for patients to recover 
from exacerbations over time.
11 In two 
separate studies, frequent exacerba-
tions contributed to a long-term de-
cline in lung function (measured as 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
[FEV
1]) in patients with moderate-to-
severe COPD. 12,13 In another study, 
symptom burden and exacerbation 
frequency were strongly correlated 
with the health-related quality of life 
in patients with moderate or severe 
COPD.
14 These results suggest that 
treatments that reduce exacerbation 
frequency could have a significant im-
pact on health status and disease pro-
gression. Interestingly, even a single 
exacerbation could result in a signif -
icant increase in the rate of decline 
in lung function
15 and a sustained 
worsening of health status in patients 
with acute exacerbation of chronic 
bronchitis who likely had COPD as 
well.
16
Numerous studies have docu-
mented the association between 
exacerbation history and future  
exacerbation events ( Table 1). 4,17-22 
Exacerbations are a major contributor 
to disease progression, with acceler -
ated lung-function decline in patients 
who experience exacerbations, and the 
greatest decline seen in patients with 
mild disease.
23 Severe exacerbations 
are also associated with a significant 
increase in mortality,24 making preven-
tion of exacerbations the key goal in 
management of COPD.
1 Furthermore, 
the Global Initiative for Chronic 
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 
recommendations place a major 
focus on the role of exacerbations in 
determining treatment options with 
the updated ABCD disease risk stratifi-
cation tool (Figure 1).
1
Management of COPD
Stable COPD.   Reduction in 
the risk of exacerbation, along with 
symptom management, is the cor -
nerstone of the current strategy for 
management of COPD.1 The main com-
ponents of COPD management are 
appropriate pharmacotherapy (that 
addresses both symptom management 
and exacerbation prevention), promo-
tion of smoking cessation, pulmonary 
rehabilitation, and regular follow-up 
monitoring for disease progression.
The GOLD ABCD tool combines 
symptom severity, using either the 
COPD Assessment Test score or the 
modified Medical Research Council 
scale, together with exacerbation risk, 
determined by either spirometry-
defined airflow limitation or exacer -
bation history, to categorize patients 
into disease “risk stratification” groups 
ABCD to guide pharmacotherapy 
(Figure 1).
25
Bronchodilators are central to 
management of COPD at all levels 
of severity. GOLD recommends spe-
cific treatment options for the initial 
therapy upon diagnosis of COPD in 
patients based on their ABCD clas -
sification (Figure 2A). This initial 
therapy differs from the follow-up 
treatment, which is based on current 
medication(s) and the most treatable 
trait (e.g., dyspnea or exacerbation; 
Figure 2B) after ensuring correct in-
haler technique and adherence to the 
initial treatment regimen.
1
The preference for long-acting mus-
carinic antagonist (LAMA)/long-acting 
β 
2-agonist (LABA) combinations over 
inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing 
regimens is supported by evidence  
from several studies. 26-29 In the 
LANTERN26 and ILLUMINATE27 studies, 
a combination of glycopyrronium/
indacaterol (LAMA/LABA) significantly 
improved lung function compared with 
salmeterol/fluticasone (LABA/ICS) and 
decreased the incidence of pneumonia 
in patients with moderate-to-severe 
KEY POINTS
 • Frequent exacerbations in pa -
tients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) 
are a major cause of the high 
hospital readmission rates 
and can result in deteriorated 
patient health-related quality 
of life and accentuated health
-
care costs.
 • Appropriately administered 
maintenance pharmacotherapy 
can significantly reduce symp -
toms and prevent exacerba -
tions in patients with COPD.
 • Increased awareness of treat-
ment recommendations among 
prescribers and COPD aftercare 
programs that provide patient 
support through education and 
inhaler technique training, in 
addition to pulmonary rehabil
-
itation and follow-up appoint-
ments, also have been shown 
to improve patient outcomes 
and reduce hospitalizations.

COPD. Similarly, a LAMA/LABA com-
bination of tiotropium/olodaterol pro-
vided a greater improvement in lung 
function than salmeterol/fluticasone in 
patients with moderate-to-severe COPD 
in the ENERGITO® study.
28 In the FLAME 
study,29 glycopyrronium/indacaterol 
was more effective than salmeterol/
fluticasone in reducing the rate of 
COPD exacerbations and increasing 
the time to first exacerbation in patients 
with a history of exacerbations in the 
previous year. Notably, compared with 
LABA/ICS, LAMA/LABA combination 
therapy significantly reduced the rate of 
COPD exacerbations by 31%
26 and 11%, 
respectively, in patients with moderate-
to-severe COPD who experienced either 
up to 1 or at least 1 exacerbation in the 
previous year.
A switch from LABA/ICS to LAMA/
LABA is recommended if patients do 
not respond to ICS or where risks as -
sociated with ICS are a concern.

CLINICAL REVIEW
MANAGEMENT OF COPD EXACERBATIONS
LABA/ICS triple therapy should be con-
sidered. A switch from LAMA/LABA to 
a triple therapy should be guided by 
the biomarker assessment (i.e., pa-
tients with eosinophil counts of ≥100 
cells/µL are more likely to benefit from 
the triple therapy). For patients with 
eosinophil counts of <100 cells/µL, 
roflumilast and azithromycin should 
be considered in patients with chronic 
bronchitis with severe airflow limita-
tion (FEV
1  <  50%) and who are former 
smokers, respectively.1
Trials assessing LAMA/LABA/
ICS triple therapy have shown im-
proved bronchodilator effects com-
pared with LABA/ICS and LAMA 
alone.
30-32 Furthermore, triple therapy 
was shown to reduce exacerbations 
by 23% to 35% in patients who had ex -
perienced exacerbations in the pre-
vious year compared with LABA/ICS 
alone.31,32 Escalation to triple therapy 
is recommended in the GOLD strategy 
document for patients who experience 
further exacerbations on LAMA/LABA 
or LAMA/ICS regardless of their ABCD 
assessment at diagnosis; however, 
GOLD recommendations note that 
there is a lack of direct evidence to in-
dicate whether triple therapy will offer 
any further benefits to LAMA/LABA in 
absence of a biomarker assessment.
1 
The GOLD guidelines include (since 
the 2017 update) guidance for de-es -
calation of treatment should additional 
therapies not result in incremental 
benefits, particularly with regard to re-
moving ICS from treatment if no ben-
efit is seen, if pneumonia is noted, or 
if ICS was prescribed for an inappro-
priate original indication, as deemed 
by a physician.
1 This is novel, because 
historical approaches to treating COPD 
have tended to be chronic and cumula-
tive because of the progressive nature 
of the disease. An individual treatment 
approach should always be taken be-
cause patients show varied responses 
to available therapies.
Acute exacerbation.  Short-
acting bronchodilators, particularly 
short-acting β 
2-agonists, are recom-
mended for treatment of exacerbations 
and can be combined with short-acting 
anticholinergics.1 The addition of a sys -
temic corticosteroid to the treatment 
regimen may be required for moderate-
to-severe COPD exacerbations or those 
that do not respond to short-acting 
bronchodilators. European Respiratory 
Society/American Thoracic Society 
(ERS/ATS) guidelines recommend oral 
corticosteroids over intravenous cor -
ticosteroids for patients hospitalized 
with an exacerbation.
33 Although oral 
corticosteroid therapy is beneficial in 
resolving exacerbations, duration of 
corticosteroid use should be kept to

experiencing an exacerbation, with 
both treatments resulting in similar

CLINICAL REVIEW
MANAGEMENT OF COPD EXACERBATIONS
Factors that indicate the need for in-
patient admission following onset of an 
exacerbation include patient inability 
to cope within the home environment, 
severe dyspnea and/or lack of response 
to initial treatment, and acute respira-
tory failure.
1
Opportunities for transitional 
care management.  According to 
Hurst and colleagues, 35 exacerbations 
in COPD are not random events but 
occur in a high-risk period for recur -
rent exacerbation in the 8-week period 
following an initial exacerbation. This 
finding presents a therapeutic window 
for healthcare providers for preven-
tative interventions. Reduction in the 
risk of future exacerbations is a key goal 
of COPD management, and patients 
should be started on appropriate main-
tenance therapy following an exacer -
bation.
1 Follow-up appointments after 
hospitalization for acute exacerba-
tion are recommended for all patients 
within 1 to 4 weeks and 12 to 16 weeks 
postdischarge. These appointments 
should focus on areas including treat -
ment regimen, inhaler technique, and 
measurement of symptoms.
Inhaler technique is often poor 
among patients with COPD, a factor 
that is associated with increased risk 
of ED visits and hospitalization.
36 Thus, 
initial and repeated reinforcement of 
patient education on inhaler technique 
is critical for COPD management.
1,36 
Selection of an appropriate inhaler is 
also important for managing COPD, 
because patient satisfaction with the 
inhaler is thought to influence adher -
ence.
37 Follow-up visits and patient ed-
ucation should also cover adherence to 
medication.1 Poor adherence to main-
tenance therapies is common among 
patients with COPD and is often mul-
tifactorial. As the disease progresses, 
COPD typically requires more than 
1 medication, which may not be de-
livered with similar inhalers. The use of 
multiple inhalers can be confusing to 
patients and lead to poor inhaler tech-
nique.
38 Also, the lack of generic inhaled 
options can affect cost, which also can 
negatively influence adherence. Poor 
adherence is associated with increased 
mortality rates, whereas higher adher -
ence is associated with reduced hospi-
talizations.39 In addition, errors related 
to inhaler handling are associated with 
an increased rate of severe COPD ex -
acerbations.
40 Consequently, GOLD 
2019 report, for the first time, highlights 
the importance of assessing inhaler 
technique and adherence in patients 
with poor symptom control before 
adjusting patients’ medications/treat -
ment regimen.
1 Community, clinical, 
and hospital pharmacists can provide 
medication-related education for pa-
tients with COPD, including the pur -
pose and value of taking maintenance 
medications, the importance of adher -
ence, proper inhaler technique, and 
how to troubleshoot and maintain their 
inhalers. A review of studies conducted 
during a 10-year period showed that 
inhaler training education and medi-
cation adherence by community phar -
macists had a positive impact, resulting 
in significant reduction in inhalation 
errors, improvement in the choice of 
inhalers, and better adherence to in-
haled medication.
41
Implications for the health 
system and managed care 
community
Exacerbations of COPD are a major 
cause of healthcare resource use be-
cause they increase physician office 
visits, ED visits, hospitalizations, and 
pharmacy use compared with stable 
COPD.
4-7 Data from large prospective 
and retrospective studies suggest that 
~37% to 71% of patients with COPD ex -
perience at least 1 exacerbation annu-
ally.
4,6,17,42 Exacerbations can also occur 
in patients with mild COPD but are 
underreported.
43 Among patients who 
experience a COPD exacerbation, ~9% 
to 31% require an ED visit and ~14% to 
35% require hospitalization.4,6,7,17,42
Milder exacerbations can often 
be treated on an outpatient basis, but 
those which are moderate to severe in 
nature may prompt ED visits or hospi-
talization, leading to higher treatment 
costs with increased exacerbation fre-
quency and severity ( Table 2).
4,6,18,42,44-49  
Mean cost of treatment for a severe 
exacerbation that requires hospitaliza-
tion can range from $7,000 to $39,200, 
with costs substantially elevated for pa-
tients who require mechanical ventila-
tion (Table 2). Comorbidities, including 
cardiovascular disease and lung cancer, 
are common in patients with COPD and 
are significantly associated with both 
higher costs and increased mortality 
following hospitalization for a COPD 
exacerbation.
45 Survival rates at 5 years 
after a hospitalization for a COPD exac-
erbation are estimated to be only 45%.24
Hospital readmissions within 
30  days of discharge after an acute 
COPD exacerbation occur in ~20% of 
patients.
8 Studies have shown that fac -
tors associated with re-exacerbation 
and readmission include longer du-
ration of hospital stay, low FEV
1, 
comorbidities, high modified Medical 
Research Council dyspnea score, and 
previous admissions.
50,51 A  study of 
90-day readmission rates following 
acute exacerbations found that read-
mission was ~35% and was significantly 
associated with increased mortality 
(13.4% in readmitted versus 2.3% in 
nonreadmitted patients).
50
Patients who experience numerous 
readmissions may have a phenotype 
known as the “frequent exacerbator. ” 52 
It is hypothesized that patients with this 
phenotype have an altered adaptive 
(CD4 and CD8 T cell) immune system 
that attenuates an inflammatory re-
sponse, facilitating COPD exacerba-
tions.
53 However, this phenotype is not 
only seen in patients with the most se-
vere airflow obstruction. The ECLIPSE 
study found that 22%, 33%, and 47% 
of patients with moderate, severe, and 
very severe airflow obstruction, respec-
tively, were frequent exacerbators.
18 
This high prevalence of the frequent-
exacerbator phenotype, even among 
patients with moderate airflow obstruc-
tion, is particularly concerning because 
of the detrimental effects that exacer -
bations exert, including accelerating 
lung-function decline, reducing quality 
of life, and increasing hospitalizations 
and mortality.
52 These factors, together 
with implementation of the Afford-
able Care Act Hospital Readmissions

CLINICAL REVIEW
MANAGEMENT OF COPD EXACERBATIONS
Reduction Program, whereby hospitals 
with higher-than-expected 30-day re-
admission rates for COPD are finan-
cially penalized, have highlighted the 
need for strategies to reduce readmis -
sions and improve overall patient care.
8
Several studies have assessed re-
admission characteristics and trialed 
ways to reduce readmissions following 
discharge after acute exacerbation. 
A  disease-management program for 
COPD, which provided follow-up in the 
community after hospital discharge, 
was found to reduce COPD-related and 
all-cause 60- and 90-day readmission 
rates.
54 This program included home 
visits, clinical assessment, medication 
review, inhaler technique training, and 
disease-education components. Care 
team members typically included a 
nurse practitioner, a registered nurse, 
and a respiratory therapist.
53 Patients 
discharged to skilled nursing facilities 
were found to be less likely to be re-
admitted to a hospital within 30 days of 
discharge than those discharged home, 
with or without home care (18.8%, 
27.7%, and 31.1% readmission rates, 
respectively).
8 In a prospective, obser -
vational study, a COPD care bundle, 
involving a multidisciplinary team of 
respiratory therapists, pulmonologists, 
pharmacists, critical care physicians, 
general internists, and nurses, was also 
found to improve care of patients with 
COPD exacerbations.
55 This bundle 
included standard nursing protocols, 
patient education on inhaler use and 
medication, and postdischarge refer -
rals to pulmonologists and was found 
to significantly reduce 30- and 60-day 
readmissions compared with con-
trol (9.1% versus 54.4% for 30-day and 
22.7% versus 77.0% for 60-day). Length 
of hospital stay was also reduced fol-
lowing implementation of the care 
bundle, as were the total aggregate 
hospital costs at 90 days postdischarge, 
which were reduced from $19,954 to 
$7,652.
In contrast, others have found that 
use of care bundles did not result in 
reduced readmission rates in patients 
with acute exacerbations of COPD.
56,57 
In a single-center randomized study, 
a care bundle that included smoking 
cessation counseling, patient educa-
tion, and telephone follow-up did not 
reduce 30- and 60-day readmission 
rates.
56 Similarly, a Medicare Bundled 
Payments for Care Improvement 
Initiative, in which patients were 
more likely to receive telephone fol-
low-up, pulmonary rehabilitation, 
pulmonologist appointments, and 
home care, did not significantly reduce 
30- or 90-day readmissions and was 
found not to be cost-effective.
57
Pulmonary rehabilitation programs 
that involve a multidisciplinary ap-
proach, including exercise therapy and 
patient education, have been shown to 
improve health-related quality of life in 
patients with COPD.
58 A  5-year study 
of the use of a pulmonary rehabilita-
tion program with negative pressure 
ventilation found that during the first 
4 years, patients with pulmonary reha-
bilitation and negative pressure venti-
lation had increased exercise capacity 
and reduced lung-function decline.
59 
Furthermore, in patients who received 
pulmonary rehabilitation and negative 
pressure ventilation, risk of exacerba-
tions requiring ED visit or hospitali-
zation was reduced by 66% and 54%, 
respectively, and annual total medical 
costs were reduced when compared 
with patients who were assigned to an 
exercise program alone ($3,274 ± $1,604 
versus $4,335  ±  $3,269). ERS/ATS 
guidelines recommend starting pul-
monary rehabilitation within 3 weeks 
of hospital discharge.
33 Limited access 
to pulmonary rehabilitation remains an 
issue for many patients who could oth-
erwise benefit from this resource.1
Maintenance medication therapy 
remains a key strategy to reduce hospi-
talizations due to acute COPD exacer -
bations. The timing of maintenance 
therapy initiation following an acute 
exacerbation in naive patients can sig-
nificantly affect outcomes, with pa-
tients who started maintenance more 
than 30  days postdischarge having sig-
nificantly higher risk (43%) of COPD-
related hospitalization or ED visit in the 
following year.
60 Others have agreed with 
these findings and found that initiating 
maintenance therapy within the first 
30  days of discharge resulted in signifi-
cantly reduced COPD-related ED visits 
(36.7%), office visits (12.1%), and outpa-
tient costs (39.0%) in the following year.
61 
A  large retrospective study of claims 
data found that after a moderate exac -
erbation requiring a prescription for an 
oral corticosteroid, only 25% of patients 
were prescribed maintenance therapy.
62 
Based on data from the TORCH trial, ad-
herence to maintenance medication is 
also vitally important in reducing hospi-
talizations and mortality.
39
Conclusion
COPD exacerbations, particularly 
those that require ED visits or hospital-
ization, lead to substantial economic 
burden. Patients who have frequent 
exacerbations have reduced quality of 
life and accelerated disease progres -
sion. Appropriate therapy with mainte-
nance bronchodilators has been shown 
to reduce exacerbation frequency but is 
underused, highlighting a need for in-
creased awareness of treatment recom-
mendations among treating physicians, 
prescribers, and healthcare organiza-
tions in which patient care could be 
improved. Several studies have found 
that COPD aftercare programs that in-
crease patient support are beneficial 
in improving outcomes and reducing 
hospitalizations. Programs that include 
referrals to pulmonologists, patient ed-
ucation and inhaler technique training, 
and pulmonary rehabilitation have 
been shown to be successful and, in 
combination with appropriate mainte-
nance therapy, could improve the lives 
of patients with frequent exacerbations. 
This highlights that continuing the 
move toward integrated care of COPD 
is the way to achieve better outcomes.
