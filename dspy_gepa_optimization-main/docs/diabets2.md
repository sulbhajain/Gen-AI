Abstract
T ype 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder in 
which prevalence has been increasing steadily all over the world. 
As a result of this trend, it is fast becoming an epidemic in some 
countries of the world with the number of people affected expected 
to double in the next decade due to increase in ageing population, 
thereby adding to the already existing burden for healthcare 
providers, especially in poorly developed countries. This review is 
based on a search of Medline, the Cochrane Database of Systemic 
Reviews, and citation lists of relevant publications. Subject 
heading and key words used include type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
prevalence, current diagnosis, and current treatment. Only articles 
in English were included. Screening and diagnosis is still based 
on World Health Organization (WHO) and American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) criteria which include both clinical and 
laboratory parameters. No cure has yet been found for the disease; 
however, treatment modalities include lifestyle modifications, 
treatment of obesity, oral hypoglycemic agents, and insulin 
sensitizers like metformin, a biguanide that reduces insulin 
resistance, is still the recommended first line medication especially 
for obese patients. Other effective medications include non-
sulfonylurea secretagogues, thiazolidinediones, alpha glucosidase 
inhibitors, and insulin. Recent research into the pathophysiology 
of type 2 DM has led to the introduction of new medications 
like glucagon-like peptide 1 analogoues: dipeptidyl peptidase-IV 
inhibitors, inhibitors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 and 
11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1, insulin-releasing glucokinase 
activators and pancreatic-G-protein-coupled fatty-acid-receptor 
agonists, glucagon-receptor antagonists, metabolic inhibitors of 
hepatic glucose output and quick-release bromocriptine. Inhaled 
insulin was licensed for use in 2006 but has been withdrawn from 
the market because of low patronage.
Keywords: T ype 2 diabetes mellitus; Diagnosis; Management; 
Newer drugs.
Introduction 
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is probably one of the oldest diseases 
known to man. It was first reported in Egyptian manuscript about 
3000 years ago. 1 In 1936, the distinction between type 1 and type 
2 DM was clearly made. 2 T ype 2 DM was first described as a 
component of metabolic syndrome in 1988.3 T ype 2 DM (formerly 
known as non-insulin dependent DM) is the most common form 
of DM characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and 
relative insulin deficiency.
4 T ype 2 DM results from interaction 
between genetic, environmental and behavioral risk factors. 5,6
People living with type 2 DM are more vulnerable to various 
forms of both short- and long-term complications, which often lead 
to their premature death. This tendency of increased morbidity 
and mortality is seen in patients with type 2 DM because of the 
commonness of this type of DM, its insidious onset and late 
recognition, especially in resource-poor developing countries like 
Africa.
7
Epidemiology
It is estimated that 366 million people had DM in 2011; by 2030 
this would have risen to 552 million.
8 The number of people with 
type 2 DM is increasing in every country with 80% of people with 
DM living in low- and middle-income countries. DM caused 4.6 
million deaths in 2011.
8 It is estimated that 439 million people 
would have type 2 DM by the year 2030. 9 The incidence of type 2 
DM varies substantially from one geographical region to the other 
as a result of environmental and lifestyle risk factors.
10
Literature search has shown that there are few data available 
on the prevalence of type 2 DM in Africa as a whole. Studies 
examining data trends within Africa point to evidence of a 
dramatic increase in prevalence in both rural and urban setting, 
and affecting both gender equally.
11
The majority of the DM burden in Africa appears to be type 
2 DM, with less than 10% of DM cases being type 1 DM. 11 A 
2011 Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report 
estimates that DM affects about 25.8 million people in the US 
(7.8% of the population) in 2010 with 90% to 95% of them being 
type 2 DM.
12
It is predicted that the prevalence of DM in adults of which 
type 2 DM is becoming prominent will increase in the next two 
decades and much of the increase will occur in developing countries 
where the majority of patients are aged between 45 and 64 years.

It is projected that the latter will equal or even exceed the former 
in developing nations, thus culminating in a double burden as a 
result of the current trend of transition from communicable to 
non-communicable diseases.
14
Lifestyle, Genetics, and Medical Conditions
T ype 2 DM is due primarily to lifestyle factors and genetics.
15 
A number of lifestyle factors are known to be important to the 
development of type 2 DM. These are physical inactivity, sedentary 
lifestyle, cigarette smoking and generous consumption of alcohol.
16 
Obesity has been found to contribute to approximately 55% of cases 
of type 2 DM.
17 The increased rate of childhood obesity between 
the 1960s and 2000s is believed to have led to the increase in type 
2 DM in children and adolescents.
18 Environmental toxins may 
contribute to the recent increases in the rate of type 2 DM. A weak 
positive correlation has been found between the concentration in 
the urine of bisphenol A, a constituent of some plastics, and the 
incidence of type 2 DM.
19
There is a strong inheritable genetic connection in type 2 DM, 
having relatives (especially first degree) with type 2 DM increases 
the risks of developing type 2 DM substantially. Concordance 
among monozygotic twins is close to 100%, and about 25% of 
those with the disease have a family history of DM.
20 Recently, 
genes discovered to be significantly associated with developing 
type 2 DM, include TCF7L2, PPARG, FTO, KCNJ11, NOTCH2, 
WFS1, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, JAZF1, and HHEX . 
KCNJ11 (potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, 
member 11), encodes the islet ATP-sensitive potassium channel 
Kir6.2, and TCF7L2  (transcription factor 7-like 2) regulates 
proglucagon gene expression and thus the production of glucagon-
like peptide-1.
21 Moreover, obesity (which is an independent risk 
factor for type 2 DM) is strongly inherited. 22 Monogenic forms 
like Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), constitutes 
up to 5% of cases.
23 There are many medical conditions which 
can potentially give rise to, or exacerbate type 2 DM. These 
include obesity, hypertension, elevated cholesterol (combined 
hyperlipidemia), and with the condition often termed metabolic 
syndrome (it is also known as Syndrome X, Reaven's syndrome).
24 
Other causes include acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, 
thyrotoxicosis, pheochromocytoma, chronic pancreatitis, cancer, 
and drugs.
25 Additional factors found to increase the risk of type 
2 DM include aging, 26 high-fat diets, and a less active lifestyle. 27
Pathophysiology
T ype 2 DM is characterized by insulin insensitivity as a result 
of insulin resistance, declining insulin production, and eventual 
pancreatic beta-cell failure.
28,29  This leads to a decrease in 
glucose transport into the liver, muscle cells, and fat cells. There 
is an increase in the breakdown of fat with hyperglycemia. The 
involvement of impaired alpha-cell function has recently been 
recognized in the pathophysiology of type 2 DM.
30
As a result of this dysfunction, glucagon and hepatic glucose 
levels that rise during fasting are not suppressed with a meal. 
Given inadequate levels of insulin and increased insulin resistance, 
hyperglycemia results. The incretins are important gut mediators 
of insulin release, and in the case of GLP-1, of glucagon suppression. 
Although GIP activity is impaired in those with type 2 DM, GLP-
1 insulinotropic effects are preserved, and thus GLP
-1 r
epresents 
a potentially beneficial therapeutic option. 30 However, like GIP; 
GLP-1 is rapidly inactivated by DPP-IV in vivo.
T wo therapeutic approaches to this problem have been 
developed: GLP-1 analogues with increased half-lives, and DPP-
IV inhibitors, which prevent the breakdown of endogenous GLP-
1 as well as GIP.
30 Both classes of agents have shown promise, 
with potential not only to normalize fasting and postprandial 
glucose levels but also to improve beta-cell functioning and mass. 
Studies are ongoing on the role of mitochondrial dysfunction 
in the development of insulin resistance and etiology of type 2 
DM.
31 Also very important is adipose tissue, as endocrine organ 
hypothesis (secretion of various adipocytokines, i.e., leptin, TNF-
alpha, resistin, and adiponectin implicated in insulin resistance 
and possibly beta-cell dysfunction).
30
A majority of individuals suffering from type 2 DM are obese, 
with central visceral adiposity. Therefore, the adipose tissue plays 
a crucial role in the pathogenesis of type 2 DM. Although the 
predominant theory used to explain this link is the portal/visceral 
hypothesis giving a key role in elevated non-esterified fatty acid 
concentrations, two new emerging theories are the ectopic fat 
storage syndrome (deposition of triglycerides in muscle, liver and 
pancreatic cells). These two hypotheses constitute the framework 
for the study of the interplay between insulin resistance and beta-
cell dysfunction in type 2 DM as well as between our obesogenic 
environment and DM risk in the next decade.
30
Screening and Diagnosis
Tests for screening and diagnosis of DM are readily available. The 
test recommended for screening is the same as that for making 
diagnosis, with the result that a positive screen is equivalent to a 
diagnosis of pre-diabetes or DM.
32 Although about 25% of patients 
with type 2 DM already have microvascular complications at the 
time of diagnosis suggesting that they have had the disease for 
more than 5 years at the time of diagnosis.
33 It is still based on 
the American Diabetic Association (ADA) guidelines of 1997 or 
World Health Organization (WHO) National diabetic group 
criteria of 2006, which is for a single raised glucose reading with 
symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia and weight loss), 
otherwise raised values on two occasions, of either fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG) ≥7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or with an oral glucose 
tolerance test (OGTT), two hours after the oral dose a plasma 
glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL).
32
The 1997 ADA recommendations for diagnosis of DM focus 
on the FPG, while WHO focuses on the OGTT. 32 The glycated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fructosamine is also still useful for 
determining blood sugar control over time. However, practicing 
physicians frequently employ other measures in addition to those 
recommended. In July 2009, the International Expert Committee

Oman Medical Specialty Board
(IEC) rec ommended the additional diagnostic criteria of an 
HbA1c result ≥6.5% for DM. This committee suggested that the 
use of the term pre-diabetes may be phased out but identified the 
range of HbA1c levels ≥ 6.0% and <6.5% to identify those at high 
risk of developing DM.34
As with the glucose-based tests, there is no definite threshold 
of HbA1c at which normality ends and DM begins. 32 The IEC 
has elected to recommend a cut-off point for DM diagnosis that 
emphasizes specificity, commenting that this balanced the stigma 
and cost of mistakenly identifying individuals as diabetic against 
the minimal clinical consequences of delaying the diagnosis in a 
patient with an HbA1c level <6.5%.
34
Management
Through lifestyle and diet modification. Studies have shown that 
there was significant reduction in the incidence of type 2 DM with 
a combination of maintenance of body mass index of 25 kg/m
2, 
eating high fibre and unsaturated fat and diet low in saturated and 
trans-fats and glycemic index, regular exercise, abstinence from 
smoking and moderate consumption of alcohol.
5,16,35-37 Suggesting 
that majority of type 2 DM can be prevented by lifestyle 
modification. Patients with type 2 DM should receive a medical 
nutrition evaluation; lifestyle recommendations should be tailored 
according to physical and functional ability.
38
Pharmacological Agents
Biguanides
Biguanides, of which metformin is the most commonly used 
in overweight and obese patients, suppresses hepatic glucose 
production, increases insulin sensitivity, enhances glucose uptake 
by phosphorylating GLUT -enhancer factor, increases fatty acid 
oxidation, and decreases the absorption of glucose from the 
gastrointestinal tract.
39 Research published in 2008 shows further 
mechanism of action of metformin as activation of AMP-activated 
protein kinase, an enzyme that plays a role in the expression of 
hepatic gluconeogenic genes.
40 Due to the concern of development 
of lactic acidosis, metformin should be used with caution in elderly 
diabetic individuals with renal impairment. It has a low incidence 
of hypoglycemia compared to sulfonylureas.
39
Sulfonylureas
These generally well tolerated but because they stimulate 
endogenous insulin secretion, they carry a risk of hypoglycemia.
38 
Elderly patients, with DM who are treated with sulfonylureas 
have a 36% increased risk of hypoglycemia compared to 
younger patients.
41 Glyburide is associated with higher rates of 
hypoglycemia compared to glipizide. 42 Some of the risk factors 
for hypoglycemia are age-related impaired renal function, 
simultaneous use of insulin or insulin sensitizers, age greater 
than 60 years, recent hospital discharge, alcohol abuse, caloric 
restriction, multiple medications or medications that potentiate 
sulfonylurea actions.
43 Use of long acting sulfonylurea such as 
glyburide should be avoided in elderly patients with DM and use 
of short-acting glipizide should be preferred. 38
Meglitinides
Repaglinide and nateglinide are non-sulfonylurea secretagogues 
which act on the ATP-dependent K-channel in the pancreatic 
beta cells thereby stimulating the release of insulin from the beta 
cells, similar to sulfonylurea, though the binding site is different.
44 
Meglitinides have a rapid onset and a short duration of action 
(4-6 hrs) and thus lower risk of hypoglycemia. Meglitinides are 
given before meals for postprandial blood glucose control. Pre-
prandial administration allows flexibility in case a meal is missed 
without increased risk of hypoglycemia.
45 Repaglinide is mainly 
metabolized in the liver with very minimal amounts excreted via 
the kidneys and thus dose adjustment is not necessary in patients 
with renal insufficiency except those with end-stage renal disease.
44
Thiazolidinediones
Thiazolidinedione is an insulin sensitizer, selective ligands 
transcription factor peroxisomes proliferator-activated gamma. 
They are the first drugs to address the basic problem of insulin 
resistance in type 2 DM patients,
46 whose class now includes mainly 
pioglitazone after the restricted use of rosiglitazone recommended 
by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently due to increased 
cardiovascular events reported with rosiglitazone.
36 Pioglitazone 
use is not associated with hypoglycemia and can be used in cases 
of renal impairment and thus well tolerated in older adults. On 
the other hand, due to concerns regarding peripheral edema, fluid 
retention and fracture risk in women, its use can be limited in 
older adults with DM. Pioglitazone should be avoided in elderly 
patients with congestive heart failure and is contraindicated in 
patients with class III-IV heart failure.
47
Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors
Acarbose, Voglibose and Miglitol have not widely been used to 
treat type 2 DM individuals but are likely to be safe and effective. 
These agents are most effective for postprandial hyperglycemia and 
should be avoided in patients with significant renal impairment. 
Their use is usually limited due to high rates of side-effects such 
as diarrhoea and flatulence.
38 Voglibose, which is the newest of the 
drugs, has been shown in a study to significantly improve glucose 
tolerance, in terms of delayed disease progression and in the 
number of patients who achieved normoglycemia.
48
Incretin-Based Therapies
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues are the foundation 
of incretin-based therapies which are to target this previously 
unrecognized feature of DM pathophysiology resulting in 
sustained improvements in glycemic control and improved body 
weight control.
49 They are available for use as monotherapy, 
as an adjunct to diet and exercise or in combination with oral 
hypoglycemic agents in adults with type 2 DM. Examples are 
Exenatide, an incretin mimetic, and Liraglutide.
38
There is no risk of hypoglycemia with the use of GLP-
1 therapies (unless combined with insulin secretagogues). In 
addition, emerging evidence suggests incretin-based therapies

may have a positive impact on inflammation, cardiovascular and 
hepatic health, sleep, and the central nervous system. 49
Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors
Dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP) IV inhibitors inhibit dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 (DPP-4), a ubiquitous enzyme that rapidly inactivates 
both GLP-1 and GIP, increase active levels of these hormones and, 
in doing so, improves islet function and glycemic control in type 2 
DM.
50 DPP-4 inhibitors are a new class of anti-diabetogenic drugs 
that provide comparable efficacy to current treatments. They 
are effective as monotherapy in patients inadequately controlled 
with diet and exercise and as add-on therapy in combination with 
metformin, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. The DPP-4 inhibitors 
are well tolerated, carry a low risk of producing hypoglycemia and 
are weight neutral. However, they are relatively expensive.
50 The 
long-term durability of effect on glycemic control and beta-cell 
morphology and function remain to be established.
50,51
Insulin
Insulin is used alone or in combination with oral hypoglycemic 
agents. Augmentation therapy with basal insulin is useful if 
some beta cell function remains. Replacement of basal-bolus 
insulin is necessary if beta cell exhaustion occurs. Rescue therapy 
using replacement is necessary in cases of glucose toxicity which 
should mimic the normal release of insulin by the beta cells of the 
pancreas.
52 Insulin comes in injectable forms - rapid acting, short 
acting, intermediate acting and long acting. The long acting forms 
are less likely to cause hypoglycemia compared to the short acting 
forms.
Insulin analogues
Insulin therapy was limited in its ability to mimic normal 
physiologic insulin secretion. Traditional intermediate- and long-
acting insulins (NPH insulin, lente insulin, and ultralente insulin) 
are limited by inconsistent absorption and peaks of action that 
may result in hypoglycemia.
53,54 The pharmacokinetic profiles of 
the new insulin analogues are distinct from those of the regular 
insulins, and their onset and durations of action range from rapid 
to prolonged. Currently, two rapid-acting insulin analogues, 
insulin lispro and insulin aspart, and one long-acting insulin 
analogue, insulin glargine, are available.
53,54
Future in Drug Therapy Inhaled Insulin
The inhaled form of rapidly acting insulin which became available 
in 2006,
55 after it was approved by both the European Medicines 
Evaluation Agency and FDA for treatment of type 1 and type 
2 DM in adults.
55-57 It is a rapid acting form of insulin that was 
indicated for use in adults with type 1 and type 2 DM and has the 
advantage of delivery directly into the lungs. Studies have however 
shown that inhaled insulin is as effective as, but not better than 
short acting insulin.
55 It was withdrawn from the market by the 
manufacturer in October 2007 due to poor sales.
Bromocriptine
Quick-release bromocriptine has recently been developed for the 
treatment of type 2 DM. However, the mechanism of action is not 
clear. Studies have shown that they reduce the mean HbA1c levels 
by 0.0% to 0.2% after 24 weeks of therapy.
58
Others
Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, which increase 
renal glucose elimination, and inhibitors of 11ß-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase 1, which reduce the glucocorticoid effects in liver 
and fat. Insulin-releasing glucokinase activators and pancreatic-
G-protein-coupled fatty-acid-receptor agonists, glucagon-receptor 
antagonists, and metabolic inhibitors of hepatic glucose output are 
being assessed for the purpose of development of new drug therapy 
for type 2 diabetic patients.
59
Conclusion
T ype 2 DM is a metabolic disease that can be prevented through 
lifestyle modification, diet control, and control of overweight and 
obesity. Education of the populace is still key to the control of this 
emerging epidemic. Novel drugs are being developed, yet no cure 
is available in sight for the disease, despite new insight into the 
pathophysiology of the disease. Management should be tailored to 
improve the quality of life of individuals with type 2 DM.
