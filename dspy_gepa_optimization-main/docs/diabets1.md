Abstract
This review article conducts a comprehensive analysis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and its
ramifications for both maternal health and the well-being of their offspring. GDM is a significant pregnancy
complication in which women who have never had diabetes acquire chronic hyperglycemia during their
gestational period. In most cases, hyperglycemia is caused by impaired glucose tolerance caused by
pancreatic beta cell dysfunction in the background of chronic insulin resistance. Being overweight or obese,
having an older mother age, and having a family history of any type of diabetes are all risk factors for
developing GDM. GDM consequences include a higher risk of maternal cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
type 2 diabetes, as well as macrosomia and delivery difficulties in the newborn. There is also a longer-term
risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in the infant. Premature birth, hypoglycemia at
birth, and shoulder dystocia are also a few of the fetal problems that can result from GDM. Unfortunately,
there is no widely acknowledged treatment or preventative strategy for GDM at the moment, except lifestyle
modification (diet and exercise) and, on occasion, insulin therapy, which is only of limited value due to the
insulin resistance that is commonly present. Although new oral medications for diabetes management, such
as glyburide and metformin, show potential, there are ongoing worries regarding their safety over an
extended period for both the mother and the child. By identifying gaps in the research, it calls for further
investigations and a multidisciplinary approach, ultimately aiming to enhance the management and care for
women with GDM, which would impact these affected individuals indubitably.

Introduction And Background
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a metabolic condition of pregnancy that presents as newly
developing hyperglycemia in pregnant women who did not have diabetes before getting pregnant, and it
normally resolves after giving birth 
[1]
. Around 9% of pregnancies around the globe are affected by this
prevalent antepartum condition 
[2]
. Although one can develop GDM at any instance during the entire course
of pregnancy, it is typically seen between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy. Additionally, the prevalence of
GDM is growing globally due to an increase in maternal weight gain, maternal age, and inactivity 
[3]
. The
etiology of GDM is explained by the maternal pancreas' inability to adjust to the increased insulin demand
throughout gestation. During pregnancy, the body becomes less responsive to insulin, which leads to an
increased production of insulin by pancreatic beta cells 
[4]
. Insulin, which is secreted by these beta cells,
plays a vital role in promoting the uptake of glucose by peripheral tissues, reducing the synthesis of glucose
in the liver, and controlling the release of lipids from adipose tissue. However, if regular levels of insulin fail
to achieve the desired response from insulin receptors, insulin resistance can develop. Consequently, beta
cells must produce more insulin than usual to maintain normal maternal blood glucose levels 
[1]
. This
insulin resistance is a natural part of a healthy pregnancy and is induced by placental hormones to ensure
the fetus receives the necessary nourishment for proper growth and development. Maternal beta cells
respond by increasing their number, insulin production, and release to sustain glucose balance despite
insulin resistance 
[5]
. However, when maternal beta cells cannot adapt to the metabolic changes associated
with pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) results in hyperglycemia.
GDM is essential to detect and treat during pregnancy due to the harmful impact it has on both the mother
and the fetus, in both the short and long runs. Gestational diabetes can cause short-term pregnancy
complications such as high blood pressure, the necessity for a cesarean section (C-section), pre-eclampsia,
and difficulty during childbirth 
[6]
. In the long run, it may reappear in subsequent pregnancies, increasing
the mother's risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life 
[7,8]
. Many recent researches have focused on
treating GDM with GM-targeting techniques. Several prior research have looked at the influence of

probiotics on the progression of GDM, but results have been ambiguous. GDM treatment tries to reduce the
hazards for both the mother and the infant by controlling excessive blood sugar levels. Mothers must learn
about the illness in order to achieve the best possible blood sugar control in GDM patients. The primary
therapies for GDM involve adopting lifestyle changes such as modifying your diet, exercising regularly, and
maintaining a healthy weight. Medication may be an option if high blood sugar persists despite all of these
changes. GDM medication comprises glucose-lowering drugs, metformin, glibenclamide, and insulin

.
Women having GDM are recommended to discontinue any medication they were using for the condition
postpartum due to the quick return of insulin sensitivity

Review
Search methodology
We undertook a comprehensive search through PubMed and CENTRAL in June 2023 using keywords such as
"gestational diabetes mellitus" and "type 2 diabetes mellitus" ((gestational diabetes mellitus [title/abstract])
OR (GDM [title/abstract])) OR (macrosomia [title/abstract]) OR ("gestational diabetes mellitus" [MeSH
terms]) AND (("type 2 diabetes mellitus" [title/abstract]) OR (T2DM [title/abstract])) OR ("type 2 diabetes
mellitus" [MeSH terms]). Additionally, we looked through the bibliographies of pertinent research to find
important references. In July 2023, the search was updated. Two reviewers independently checked the
retrieved papers against the inclusion criteria based on the title and abstract first and then the full
texts (Figure 
1
).

Effects on the mother
GDM subsequently causes several short- and long-term complications with regard to maternal health. Along
with the challenges of a typical pregnancy, GDM may contribute to depression in prenatal 
[11]
. In many
instances, the baby must be delivered surgically due to the increased risk of issues in subsequent

pregnancies, such as premature birth and hypertension 
[12]
. Women who have been diagnosed with GDM are
significantly more likely to develop diabetes mellitus later in life. Nearly 10% of women with gestational
diabetes mellitus are diagnosed with diabetes mellitus shortly post giving birth 
[13]
. Without particular
interventions to lower their chance of developing diabetes mellitus, the remainder seem to develop the
disease at rates of 20%-60% within 5-10 years following the index pregnancy. However, not all women
having gestational diabetes will develop diabetes mellitus, according to limited long-term data from
O'Sullivan, but most of them will 
[14]
. Similar to prenatal issues, the risk of postpartum diabetes mellitus is
increased by GDM. Regardless, the risk of prenatal problems brought on by GDM is substantially lower than
the likelihood of the mother developing diabetes mellitus post-GDM diagnosis. Therefore, it is logical to
assume that GDM is a type of prediabetes similar to glucose intolerance in non-pregnant people 
[15]
.
Plenty of patients who have diabetes mellitus after GDM meet the pre-type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
profile, as was previously discussed. Studies on the regulation of glucose following GDM over time show
declining beta cell remuneration for insulin resistance (chronic) that may also deteriorate as time passes
[16]
. Markers of rather severe decompensation, such as elevated glucose levels, noticeable insulin resistance,
and impaired beta cell activity, are risk factors for the relatively quick onset of diabetes mellitus
following childbirth. Women exhibiting these traits might surpass the threshold of glucose levels defining
diabetes mellitus following a slight decline in their physical condition 
[17]
. Weight increase, insulin
resistance, increasing C-reactive protein levels, and declining adiponectin levels are risk factors for beta cell
deterioration at comparatively high rates, which leads to diabetes mellitus 
[18]
. These results imply that the
metabolic consequences of obesity serve a key role in the degeneration of beta cells that result in diabetes
mellitus. As will be covered below, the most effective defense against the emergence of T2DM after GDM is
the amelioration of the detrimental consequences of obesity induced by diet and exercise or by taking
medications that improve the biological makeup and operation of adipose tissue 
[19]
. Figure 
2
 aids in
comprehending the multifaceted nature of post-GDM diabetes development and highlights the significance
of managing beta cell function and addressing obesity to mitigate this risk effectively.

Metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity and other associated diseases, serves as the foundation upon
which T2DM develops. The probability of women with GDM displaying symptoms of metabolic syndrome is
higher than it is for women without GDM 
[17]
. A greater frequency of cardiovascular risk factors and
cardiovascular events is also linked to previous episodes of GDM 
[20]
. Most mothers who have GDM are
obese, and a sizable fraction of obese people also have GDM 
[21]
. According to a meta-analysis, pregnant
women who are overweight are 2.14 times more susceptible to be diagnosed with GDM than pregnant women
average in weight, obese pregnant women are 3.56 times more likely to do so, and extremely obese pregnant
women are 8.56 times more likely 
[22]
.
Complications During Pregnancy
Vaginal birth will be more challenging in case the baby is very large. There is a chance of a long labor process
during which the fetus could get clung in the birth/vaginal canal, an instrumental delivery may be required
(using forceps or a vacuum), or even an unanticipated or emergency cesarean section might be required. A
perineal tear (muscle tearing between the vagina and the anus) as well as lacerations and tears of the vaginal
tissue are more likely to occur during childbirth than when the infant is of normal size 
[23]
. Moreover, there
is a high risk of uterine atony. Heavy bleeding and postpartum hemorrhage may occur as a result of the
2023 Nakshine et al. Cureus 15(10): e47500. DOI 10.7759/cureus.47500

uterus' muscle failing to contract appropriately. Macrosomic births have an about three- to fivefold
increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage and genital tract injury 
[24]
. In addition, if the woman has already
undergone a cesarean section, there is an increased probability of tearing of the uterus along the surgical
scar tissue from the prior procedure.
Fetal complications and effects
Premature Birth
Preterm delivery is possible as a result of inducing labor early (earlier than 39 weeks and/or early rupturing
of the membrane). Although every effort has been made to induce early labor, babies are still at risk for
prematurity-related problems, such as breathing and feeding issues, infections, jaundice, admission to a
neonatal ICU, and perinatal mortality. Preterm delivery has a prevalence of roughly 10.6% worldwide when
combined with several other problematic factors such as obesity and hypertension during pregnancy 
[25]
.
Hypoglycemia at Birth
In addition to having a negative impact on mothers, GDM also harms the fetus. The growing fetus can only
produce a small amount of glucose; hence, it gets the majority of its glucose from the mother's blood. While
maternal insulin does not pass the placenta, maternal glucose does. The modified Pedersen's theory,
therefore, states that regardless of glucose stimulation, greater fetal insulin production results from extra
glucose transported across the placenta in high and uncontrolled maternal glucose levels 
[22]
. This is
corroborated by the placental expression of glucose transport proteins (GLUTs) being found to be higher in
pregnancies with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
[26]
. Additionally, insulin is known to have the ability
to activate mTOR, a powerful controller of cell proliferation. The placenta's system A and system L amino
acid transporters boost cell division and the supply of essential nutrients to the fetus as a result of elevated
maternal insulin, which also causes a surge in placental mTOR activity 
[27]
. Maternal hyperglycemia and
hyperinsulinemia can result in alterations in the fetus that are comparable to those found in GDM due to the
aforementioned causes, which can result in neonatal obesity 
[28]
. An increase in neonatal size at birth, also
known as macrosomia, is the result of excessive nutrition storage. The majority of fat is centered in the fetal
abdomen and shoulders. Macrosomic babies are born in 15%-45% of GDM pregnancies 
[22]
. Additionally,
GDM has been linked to a higher incidence of respiratory distress in newborns 
[1]
.
Shoulder Dystocia and Erb's Palsy
Shoulder dystocia, particularly linked to birth trauma, is one of the most serious consequences of
administering delivery through the vagina, specifically in macrosomic infants. Newborns weighing 4,500 g or
greater are six times more likely than others to experience birth trauma 
[23]
, and furthermore, if the birth
weight is above 4,500 g, there is an almost 20-fold increased chance of brachial plexus damage 
[29]
.
Congenital Anomalies
The most prevalent birth problems include heart defects and disorders of the neural tube, including spina
bifida. Congenital abnormalities can result from the growing fetus' organ damage caused by the elevated
blood sugar levels of women with GDM 
[30]
. Furthermore, it is not certain if GDM and fetal anomalies are
related. Congenital abnormalities are twice as common in women with pre-existing diabetes as they are in
non-diabetic individuals, demonstrating a strong association between the two diseases. The data for GDM,
however, is inconsistent 
[1]
.
Fetal Nutrition
With the onset of GDM, changes in breast milk composition are seen too. Breast milk is a continuously
changing fluid with bioactivity that greatly varies from female to female and from phase to phase. Numerous
maternal variables, including term and preterm labor, maternal diet, metabolic problems, and diseases 
[31]
,
have an impact on it. Diabetes mellitus is a long-term metabolic condition that may affect expectant
mothers whether it develops before pregnancy or if it develops during pregnancy (a newly formed syndrome)
[32]
. Citrate, lactose, and total nitrogen levels take 15-24 hours longer for mothers with gestational diabetes
to attain levels that are comparable to those of healthy women 
[33]
. Due to the beneficial correlation
between mammary gland growth during pregnancy and circulating levels of human placental lactogen,
women having gestational diabetes during their pregnancy may have a delay at the beginning of breast milk
[34]
. Pregnant women affected by gestational DM exhibited elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines in
their colostrum. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-15, and interferon-
Î³
 levels were up, whereas IL-1ra and granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) levels were decreased. This led to a modified immune
composition of the colostrum 
[35]
.
Neonatal complications
Neonatal complications can include delivery trauma, such as shoulder dystocia and a brachial plexus wound,

as well as potential hypoxia, hypoglycemia, kernicterus, and jaundice. They may also include bacterial
infections and newborn respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) 
[2]
.
Neonatal Jaundice
Prematurity, inadequate nutrition, and increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin due to decreased
hepatic conjugation of bilirubin are some factors that may contribute to jaundice. Neonates with
macrosomia have an elevated oxygen demand, which leads to elevated erythropoiesis and, ultimately,
polycythemia 
[36]
. As a consequence of this, as these cells degrade, bilirubin (a by-product of red blood
cells) rises, which causes newborn jaundice.
Childhood and adulthood complications
It is generally known that GDM and hyperglycemia in children are related. The research of the Pima Indians
in the USA was the first concrete proof that a mother's hyperglycemia may cause her offspring to develop an
adult illness. Indeed, children who have diabetic mothers experience an increased risk of obesity,
hypertension, and dyslipidemia in later adulthood 
[37]
. In 10 different countries, researchers from the
Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study discovered a direct link between maternal
hyperglycemia during pregnancy and a rise in hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in children as they grew
older 
[38]
. Additionally, compared to offspring of mothers with normal blood sugar levels, GDM progeny had
a higher homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), waist measurement, body mass
index (BMI), and triglyceride levels 
[39]
. With about 20% of offspring resulting from GDM having type 2
diabetes and prediabetes by 22, it is plausible that the development of being resistant to insulin raises the
chance of the child getting the disease 
[40]
. Along with an increased risk of illnesses including cardiovascular
conditions and resistance to insulin, the greater incidence of obesity in children of women with GDM is also
linked to an increased risk of other diseases 
[40]
. In addition to hyperglycemia and BMI, children delivered
to GDM mothers were shown to have considerably greater cardiovascular risk and adiposity. GDM kids are
more likely to experience cardiac arrhythmias and require hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)
as a result of increased cardiovascular risk 
[39]
. In addition, GDM offspring are 29% more likely to suffer
early-onset cardiovascular conditions such as cardiac failure, high blood pressure, deep vein thrombosis, and
pulmonary embolism 
[41]
. All of these researches indicate that the environment in utero affects how
metabolic illness is programmed in the child. Population studies have shown that all of these changes
experienced throughout childhood are probably to last into adulthood. Numerous studies also indicate that
the long-duration impacts of in utero GDM subjection often do not manifest themselves until adolescence,
another period that is particularly vulnerable to the development of obesity 
[23]
.
Treatment
A comprehensive strategy is needed to handle an individual with GDM as best as possible. This entails
educating patients on managing pregnancy weight gain, dietary adjustments, nutritional monitoring, and
regulating one's blood sugar levels. With enough exercise, dietary changes, and lifestyle adjustments, up to
70%-85% of those with gestational diabetes are curable 
[42]
. For 15%-30% of people, taking medication is
necessary. Insulin and oral hypoglycemics are some of them. Figure 
3
 provides a concise overview of the
management strategies to be employed for controlling GDM.

Blood Glucose Monitoring
The majority of organizations advise daily at-home self-glucose monitoring. Presently, daily self-monitoring
of postprandial and fasting blood glucose levels is encouraged. The American Diabetes Association (ADA)
advises that the target blood sugar levels be 95 mg/dL for fasting and 140 mg/dL or 120 mg/dL for one to two
hours, respectively, following a meal. Pre-existing diabetics are the main beneficiaries of pre-prandial
glucose monitoring. Screening the levels of hemoglobin A1C is not as helpful for evaluating glucose control
in GDM 
[43]
.
Dietary Modifications
Some of the dietary strategies mentioned in the literature include the DASH diet (dietary techniques to treat
hypertension), calorie-restricted diets, low-glycemic index diets, low-carbohydrate diets, low-unsaturated
fat diets, high-fiber diets, and soy-based diets. The emphasis of nutritional advice should be on a balanced
diet with reasonable portion sizes, healthy fats, complex carbs, and 20% protein 
[44]
.
Physical Exercise
Even in pregnant women with GDM, physical activity and regular exercise have been promoted and are
encouraged. The benefits of moderate exercise during pregnancy include a lower risk of gestational diabetes,
a lower potential of larger-than-normal newborns, and a lower risk of high blood pressure problems,
preterm birth, and fetal growth restriction 
[45]
. Additionally, pregnancy-related lifestyle modifications affect
the period of postpartum, reducing the chance of postpartum depression 
[46]
.
Pharmacotherapy for GDM Management
In about 15%-30% of GDM patients, blood glucose management is insufficient despite suggested dietary and
lifestyle changes, necessitating the use of medication 
[43]
. Usually, if hyperglycemia still exists throughout
the course of the day after 10-14 days of nutritional and daily living changes, medication courses should be
taken into account. Insulin and oral-route medications are administered for patients with gestational
diabetes mellitus in order to control hyperglycemia 
[47]
. Insulin provides the most secure outline during
pregnancy. The oral medications that have been researched include metformin and sulfonylureas such as
glyburide. Large molecules such as insulin cannot pass through the placenta. Metformin and glyburide have
been demonstrated to have the capacity to pass the placental barrier and reach the fetus 
[48]
. Figure

depicts functions as an illustrative guide outlining the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for gestational
diabetes mellitus.

 1: Characteristics of the study included in the article
GDM: gestational diabetes mellitus, rPL: rat placental lactogen, GCT: glucose challenge test, T2DM: type 2 diabetes mellitus, CVD: cardiovascular
disease, LGA: large for gestational age, IDM: infants of diabetic mothers, NIDM: infants of mothers without diabetes
Conclusions
Global health continues to be seriously impacted by GDM, the most common metabolic condition during
pregnancy. Characterized by elevated blood sugar levels during pregnancy, it demands our attention and a
deeper understanding due to its significant impact on the health of expectant mothers and their
children. This review shed light on the immediate and long-term consequences of GDM on pregnant
women. Short-term consequences encompass a higher likelihood of gestational hypertension, cesarean
sections, and other perinatal complications. Long-term implications involve an increased risk of developing
type 2 diabetes postpartum, highlighting the importance of continued monitoring and care for women who
have experienced GDM. Furthermore, GDM's influence on offspring is a matter of critical concern. This
review underscores that children of GDM-affected mothers face a higher risk of developing conditions such
as obesity, hypertension, and insulin resistance, which can persist into adulthood. Understanding these
intergenerational health implications is vital for proactive prevention and management.
To address GDM effectively, a multifaceted approach is required. This approach includes vigilant blood
glucose monitoring, dietary modifications, regular physical activity, and, when necessary, pharmaceutical
interventions. The effective management of GDM relies on a collaborative effort between healthcare
professionals and expectant mothers, emphasizing education and tailored care. A clinical dietitian should
provide dietary advice to all women with GDM, as dietary counseling is the cornerstone of GDM treatment.
Particular attention should be paid to carbohydrate intake, as carbohydrate type, amount, and distribution
all play a significant role in postprandial blood glucose levels. While considerable progress has been made in
GDM research and treatment, there are still gaps in knowledge and variances in clinical recommendations.
Moreover, a variety of therapy alternatives for GDM are discussed, although existing data do not support the
effectiveness of these approaches over the long term. Future research must focus on a more comprehensive
understanding of the long-term cardiometabolic risks that the offspring of GDM-affected mothers may face.
In addition, for the prevention and control of GDM, an integrated strategy combining population-wide
preventive management, intensive health education, early detection, and multidisciplinary care programs
should be strengthened, which could help reduce the risk of GDM and associated complications in the
general population and high-risk individuals, improve maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes, and
promote long-term health.
