        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you’ll learn how to load and interact with **Gemma 270M**, a small open-weight language model, using Hugging Face in Colab. We’ll start by setting up the environment, authenticating with the Hugging Face Hub, and running prompts through the model. Along the way, you’ll:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Practice **basic prompting** with Hugging Face pipelines  \n",
        "- Build helper functions for smoother experimentation  \n",
        "- Explore two test cases:  \n",
        "  - ⚽ **Football classification** (Australian vs. American teams)  \n",
        "  - 👽 **Alien speech translation** (synthetic Martian dataset)  \n",
        "- Compare how the model responds to prompts with and without system instructions  \n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook sets the foundation for later steps in the series, where we’ll fine-tune the model and evaluate its performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Presetup Instructions\n",
        "1. Get a [HuggingFace token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens), you only need need read only\n",
        "2. Acknowledge Gemma license.   https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-270m\n",
        "3. Click connect on the top right, you may need to click the drop down and select either a GPU or TPU. We'll talk more about the differences for each of these in the session.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Environment Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we can run the model, we need to install a few libraries:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **PyTorch** (for deep learning computations)  \n",
        "- **TensorBoard** (for tracking training and metrics)  \n",
        "- **Hugging Face libraries** (transformers, datasets, etc.) for loading and working with models  \n",
        "- *(Optional)* **flash-attn** for faster training if your GPU supports it (e.g. NVIDIA L4 or A100)\n",
        "\n",
